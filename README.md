Implement a module that specifies the input of the numerator without using the remainder (%),
multiplication (*) and division (/) operators.
11 is divisible or not.
If it is accepted, the output will be equal to one.
Input is given in n-digit BCD format. Given that
Each BCD digit can be represented by four bits, so the input is represented by 4n bits.
The maximum n is equal to 9.
To implement, With this module, you can add and subtract the BCD digits of the input number without considering the place value.
